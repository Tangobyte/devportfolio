        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>When I resigned my jobs I had the opportunity to study again. I always had an interest in doing IT as well as
            getting my bachelor which is why I picked this course.
            I used a lot of programs during my free time as well at work and I had an interest in how these applications
            where developed and how they functioned. My motivation comes
            from my interest and getting expierence as well. Anything that helps me develop my skills and grow as a
            person. Which is why I picked this course.

        <h2>the Assignment</h2>
        <p>This site was developed within 2 weeks using html and css. The assignments and specifications which can be
            found here: <a
                href="https://www.notion.so/Assignment-Specification-661c5ac5d7494328a58be61d00dd41e4">Assignment</a>
            the idea of the assignment was for us to be introduced into coding and for the school to see how well we
            perform with it. Setting up a site in two weeks using
            software you are not familiar with is quite the expierence, but it was good expierence and I learned a lot
            from it.</p>
        <p>I first started developing on the layout, menus and the general codes for every page. This was my first
            expierence using html and css
            so I didn't know what kinds of codes needed to be added or what was important. So the first few days was
            mostly rewritting codes and polishing the other pages.
            After that was all in working order I could later add the content which went a bit faster. If there was some
            bug or error I knew I could conclude that issue had
            possibly more to do with the content than it had with the overall code since I tested that beforehand.
