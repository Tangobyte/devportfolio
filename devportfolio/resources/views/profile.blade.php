        <h4>How would you best describe yourself?</h4>
        <p>I would describe myself as an optimistic and curious person who is quite social and I am also a teamplayer.
            My maritime background also gave me plenty of different expierences, if there is a problem I will always try
            to think of solutions.
            Also I am quite technical with engines and electrics too which is always a plus to have.

        <p>I will always asks too much questions, but I prefer to better asks too much then not enough. I will doubt a
            lot because of it
            not to mention it will make me nervous. If I would improve my weakness it would be to get more expierence and
            be more confident.
